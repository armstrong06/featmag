# Feature-based magnitude estimates for small, close events in the Yellowstone region

In this study we use features derived from short-duration waveforms segments and event location information in support vector machines to produce local magnitude estimates that are consistent with the existing University of Utah Seismograph Stations (UUSS) earthquake catalog for the Yellowstone Volcanic Region. 

Magnitudes are produced using station and distance corrections and [code](https://github.com/sgjholt/ynp_local_magnitude_recalibration) from [Holt et al., (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1785/0120210240)
